### Hi there 👋

I'm a self taught full stack developer, 

Most of my spare time has been learning to code, not easy, but i love it...:)

I am always thankful for the coding community professionals supporting people like me - producing tutorials, proving solutions for tricky parts.



One-day ill be a good enough to actually call myself a developer. 😧

Happy coding 👍
